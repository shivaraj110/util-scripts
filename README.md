personal shorthand bash scripts for making things easier
## commands
### cexec
#### a simple shell script that 
##### -executes C code & cleans up the binary file after termination 
       cexec <filename> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argn>
by default i am leaving it to support only 3 args including the filename xD
